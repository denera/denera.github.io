Hi! I am an early-career scientist at Argonne National Laboratory where I research large-scale optimization algorithms
with a focus on efficient treatment of nonlinear constraints. I am a member of the core development team for
[PETSc/TAO](https://petsc.org), one of the premiere numerical libraries in the Department of Energy software portfolio
with thousands of user-groups in and out of the national laboratory system. In this capacity, I serve as the principal
maintainer for optimization solvers in PETSc and help prepare the library for next-generation exascale supercomputer
architectures. I also make contributions in Krylov solvers, time integrators, globalization methods and other numerical
linear algebra commonly used in gradient-based optimization.

I have recently extended my research into stochastic optimization methods in machine learning, specifically in the
development of novel *constrained* optimization methods for training deep neural networks under nonlinear or 
physics-based constraints on network weights and outputs. I also collaborate with domain experts on challenging
applications in plasma physics, Earth systems modeling, and more. In the future, I hope to explore new optimization and
AI/ML applications in areas such as aviation and aerospace, renewable energy, drug discovery, autonomous vehicle
systems, and augmented reality.
