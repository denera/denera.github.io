I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Argonne National Laboratory, the principal developer for the Toolkit for Advanced 
Optimization (TAO), and an active contributor to the [PETSc](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) library. My current work 
is focused on developing gradient-based optimization algorithms for large-scale problems in scientific discovery and 
machine learning.

My research interests lie in the mathematical, algorithmic and software design challenges in promoting the use of 
numerical optimization techniques in scientific research and industrial design, with emphasis on high performance 
computing applications and efficient treatment of nonlinear constraints.
