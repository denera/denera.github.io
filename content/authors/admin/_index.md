I am a computational scientist specializing on alrge-scale gradient-based optimization algorithms, their high-performance implementations on heterogeneous computing architectures, and their applications to artificial intelligence and machine learning problems. I currently work as an AI Application Specialist at [GraphCore](https://graphcore.ai) where I help customers solve challenging ML problems using GraphCore IPUs and optimize the poplar SDK stack to improve IPU perfomance on MLPerf benchmark problems.
