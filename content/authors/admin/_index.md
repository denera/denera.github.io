I am a computational scientist specializing in large-scale nonlinear and constrained optimization algorithms, and I collaborate with domain experts on challenging problems in scientific machine learning, plasma physics, Earth systems modeling and more. I also maintain the Toolkit for Advanced Optimization (TAO) package in [PETSc/TAO](https://petsc.org) and help prepare the library for upcoming exascale computing architectures.

I have recently began to develop stochastic optimization methods in machine learning, specifically for training deep neural networks under nonlinear constraints on network weights and/or outputs. In the future, I hope to apply my research to solve challenging AI/ML problems in aviation and aerospace, renewable energy, climate science, supply chain planning, automated vehicle systems, augmented reality and more.
