I am a computational scientist specializing on gradient-based and constrained numerical optimization methods for large-scale applications
in artificial intelligence, machine learning, simulation-based design and scientific discovery. I am also a member of the core development
team for [PETSc/TAO](https://petsc.org), one of the premiere numerical libraries in the US Department of Energy research software portfolio.
In this capacity, I develop and maintain parallel implementations of optimization algorithms using test-based development and CI/CD workflows
on heterogeneous high-performance computing systems.
